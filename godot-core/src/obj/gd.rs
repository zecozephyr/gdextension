/// Smart pointer to objects owned by the Godot engine.
///
/// See also [chapter about objects][book] in the book.
///
/// This smart pointer can only hold _objects_ in the Godot sense: instances of Godot classes (`Node`, `RefCounted`, etc.)
/// or user-declared structs (declared with `#[derive(GodotClass)]`). It does **not** hold built-in types (`Vector3`, `Color`, `i32`).
///
/// `Gd<T>` never holds null objects. If you need nullability, use `Option<Gd<T>>`.
///
/// # Memory management
///
/// This smart pointer behaves differently depending on `T`'s associated types, see [`GodotClass`] for their documentation.
/// In particular, the memory management strategy is fully dependent on `T`:
///
/// - **Reference-counted**<br>
///   Objects of type [`RefCounted`] or inherited from it are **reference-counted**. This means that every time a smart pointer is
///   shared using [`Clone::clone()`], the reference counter is incremented, and every time one is dropped, it is decremented.
///   This ensures that the last reference (either in Rust or Godot) will deallocate the object and call `T`'s destructor.<br><br>
///
/// - **Manual**<br>
///   Objects inheriting from [`Object`] which are not `RefCounted` (or inherited) are **manually-managed**.
///   Their destructor is not automatically called (unless they are part of the scene tree). Creating a `Gd<T>` means that
///   you are responsible of explicitly deallocating such objects using [`free()`][Self::free].<br><br>
///
/// - **Dynamic**<br>
///   For `T=Object`, the memory strategy is determined **dynamically**. Due to polymorphism, a `Gd<Object>` can point to either
///   reference-counted or manually-managed types at runtime. The behavior corresponds to one of the two previous points.
///   Note that if the dynamic type is also `Object`, the memory is manually-managed.
///
/// # Construction
///
/// To construct default instances of various `Gd<T>` types, there are extension methods on the type `T` itself:
///
/// | Type \ Memory Strategy | Ref-counted          | Manually managed      | Singleton               |
/// |------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
/// | **Engine type**        | `Resource::new()`    | `Node::new_alloc()`   | `Os::singleton()`       |
/// | **User type**          | `MyClass::new_gd()`  | `MyClass::alloc_gd()` | _(not yet implemented)_ |
///
/// In addition, the smart pointer can be constructed in multiple ways:
///
/// * [`Gd::default()`] for reference-counted types that are constructible. For user types, this means they must expose an `init` function
///   or have a generated one. `Gd::<T>::default()` is equivalent to the shorter `T::new_gd()` and primarily useful for derives or generics.
/// * [`Gd::from_init_fn(function)`][Gd::from_init_fn] for Rust objects with `#[base]` field, which are constructed inside the smart pointer.
///   This is a very handy function if you want to pass extra parameters to your object upon construction.
/// * [`Gd::from_object(rust_obj)`][Gd::from_object] for existing Rust objects without a `#[base]` field that are moved _into_ the smart pointer.
/// * [`Gd::from_instance_id(id)`][Gd::from_instance_id] and [`Gd::try_from_instance_id(id)`][Gd::try_from_instance_id]
///   to obtain a pointer to an object which is already alive in the engine.
///
/// # Binds
///
/// The [`bind()`][Self::bind] and [`bind_mut()`][Self::bind_mut] methods allow you to obtain a shared or exclusive guard to the user instance.
/// These provide interior mutability similar to [`RefCell`][std::cell::RefCell], with the addition that `Gd` simultaneously handles reference
/// counting (for some types `T`).
///
/// When you declare a `#[func]` method on your own class and it accepts `&self` or `&mut self`, an implicit `bind()` or `bind_mut()` call
/// on the owning `Gd<T>` is performed. This is important to keep in mind, as you can get into situations that violate dynamic borrow rules; for
/// example if you are inside a `&mut self` method, make a call to GDScript and indirectly call another method on the same object (re-entrancy).
///
